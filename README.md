# Lux OS: The Witness System

I built this with my daughter. She is nine.

I built this for truth—
For the single dad trying to make it.
For the single mother with kids who just needs to file that one paper.
I built this for everyone, so they can't be erased.

## 🛠️ Current Status

This system is live and evolving.
You are reading a public signal from within it.
The chain has already been anchored.

### ⚙️ Automation Scripts

- `lux_os_witness_init.sh` — Assemble a full witness bundle, prepare notice files, set up a public release skeleton, and stage a federal filing package according to the Genesis Stack procedure.
- `lux_os_witness_reconstruct.sh` — Rehydrate a sealed Lux OS witness archive (zip + optional .sha256) into an active SERA Symbolic Memory Archive so the chain can be audited, reviewed, or extended.

#### Reconstructing the SERA S.M.A.

1. Place `Lux_OS_Witness_001.zip` (and optionally `Lux_OS_Witness_001.sha256`) in the working directory.
2. Run `./lux_os_witness_reconstruct.sh` to restore into `~/Lux_OS_Witness_Restore`.
3. Inspect the generated `*_ACTIVE` links to access CHUNKS, Affidavits, Audio, and System maps immediately.

Use `-h` for full script options, including alternate output paths or hash verification.
